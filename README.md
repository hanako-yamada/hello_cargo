## :memo: About this project

This project has the same aim as [hello_world](https://github.com/hanako-yamada/hello_world), but using Rust's Cargo tool.

In this case, the aim is to learn.

## :computer: Executing the code
First of all...

You clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanako-yamada/hello_cargo.git
```

Inside the repo folder, enter the following commands to compile and run this file:
```bash
cargo build
./target/debug/hello_cargo
```

Other way is running directly with Cargo:
```bash
cargo run
```

Easy, right? :wink:
